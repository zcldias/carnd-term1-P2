Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
Overview
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, you will then test your model program on new images of traffic signs you find on the web, or, if you're feeling adventurous pictures of traffic signs you find locally!

Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.5 and the following Python libraries installed:

Jupyter
NumPy
SciPy
scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Run this command at the terminal prompt to install OpenCV. Useful for image processing:

conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
Dataset
Download the dataset. You can download the pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32 here.

Clone the project and start the notebook.

git clone https://github.com/udacity/traffic-signs
cd traffic-signs
jupyter notebook Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb notebook.
